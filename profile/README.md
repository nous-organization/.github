> The open, decentralized platform for news, truth, and collective intelligence.

## 🌍 What is Nous?

Nous is a global, community-powered project building the future of news.  
We unite **engineers, journalists, analysts, designers, researchers, and citizens** to create a platform that promotes transparency, accountability, and open access to information.

Our mission:  
> **Build the most trustworthy, intelligent, and participatory news ecosystem in the world.**

## 🧠 Why Nous?

Modern news is broken:
- centralized
- biased
- algorithmically manipulated
- ad-driven
- controlled by a few

Nous flips that structure:  
- **Decentralized data**  
- **Open-source analysis tools**  
- **Community-driven verification**  
- **Transparent algorithms**  
- **No ads. No tracking. No paywalls.**
